## Project Scope

| Part | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Dashboard | Built an interactive Tableau dashboard with KPIs, filters, and insights |
| Forecasting | In progress: ML model (XGBoost) to predict future sales |
| Clustering | Planned: Customer segmentation using K-Means |

## Tableau Dashboard

The dashboard helps visualize key sales metrics across regions, product categories, and time.

### Key Features:
- KPIs: Total Sales, Total Orders, Avg. Order Value
- Breakdown by Month, Product Category, Segment
- Monthly trends and dynamic filters

> Built using Tableau Public. Data cleaned with SQL.

## Machine Learning (Upcoming)

The next step is to build predictive models to support business decisions:

- **Forecasting**: Use XGBoost to predict future demand based on historical sales
- **Clustering**: Segment customers/products to personalize marketing or optimize supply chain

These models will be trained in Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, etc.
